#Pygmalion 350M – AI Chatbot Web Interface 🚀
This project is an HTML + Flask Web Application using Pygmalion-350M as the backend conversational AI model. It is designed to create an online chatbot similar to Jarvis (from Iron Man) with Hinglish support and Roleplay capabilities.

#🔥 Key Features:
Web-based Chatbot: Access your AI assistant via any web browser.
Pygmalion-350M Model: Optimized lightweight conversational model (350M) for quick and engaging responses.
Roleplay & Assistant: Capable of casual talk, roleplaying, and answering general queries.
Hinglish Support: Friendly conversations mixing Hindi & English.
Flask Backend: Lightweight server to serve the model outputs.
Customizable UI: Clean, simple chat interface with scope for adding speech recognition and TTS later.
#📦 Tech Stack:
HTML / CSS – Frontend chat interface.
Python (Flask) – Backend for handling user messages and generating AI responses.
Pygmalion-350M (HuggingFace Transformers) – AI model for chat generation.
